# Project Description 
The "Drowsiness Detection and Alerting System" is an innovative project that harnesses the power of modern technology to enhance road safety and mitigate the risks associated with driver fatigue. By combining Python programming, IBM Cloud services, OpenCV, and Node-RED, this system offers a comprehensive solution for monitoring a driver's alertness during their journey.


# Softwares / Tools Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- Node-Red
- IBM Cloud

# Benefits
- Enhanced Safety: By alerting the driver when signs of drowsiness are detected, the system contributes to preventing accidents caused by fatigue-related impairment.
- Customizability: The system is flexible and can be adapted for use in personal vehicles, commercial fleets, and public transportation.
- Data Insights: By using IBM Cloud for data storage and analysis, the system can generate insights into driver behaviour and drowsiness patterns, aiding in long-term safety improvements.
- Real-time Alerts: The use of Node-RED ensures that alerts are generated promptly, enabling drivers to take immediate action to counteract drowsiness.
